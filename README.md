# brightwheel-crawler

My kid will leave a school that uses the brightwheel app and I wanted to make sure I got all the pictures before he left. This uses selnium to crawl the page, loads all images, and then passes the auth info to requests and downloads all the image files. 

I want to add image recognition to this to be able to parse out my kids face or remove ones that are likely just updates from the school, maybe that will come later.
